## Introduction

#### 
Hi I'm Asaf and I am currently taking the Aicore course following the Data Analytics career path. In this project, I intend to practice Object-Oriented Programming and other advanced concepts in Python. 

## Description

####
As you can assume from the title, in this project I will be replicating the classic childhood game Hangman. The aim of my project is to test my learning thus far in the course beyond just completing exercises. I hope that by the end of this project, I will have a strong grasp of Object-Oriented Programming and fundamental concepts in programming. 

In the milestone_2.py file, I first created a list of words (fruit themed) and chose a random word from it to start the game. I then developed the logic to check if, the letter entered by the user is valid, and whether the letter is in the random word. 

Next, in the milestone_3.py file, I cleaned up the code by adding the above logic into functions - check_guess and ask_for_input.

But I included the bulk of the project in the milestone_4.py file which consists of all the game logic. This part of the project was the toughest but it really helped me learn OOP practically rather than theoretically, as well as strength previous python concepts that I had learned and develop an understanding on how they are used in projects rather than in simple exercises. These included for loops, while loops, if statements and data structures (sets and lists).
