## Introduction

#### 
Hi I'm Asaf and I am currently taking the Aicore course following the Data Analytics career path and this project is apart of the course, in which its intended purpose is to practice object-oriented programming and other advanced concepts in python. 

## Description

####
As you can assume from the title, in this project I will be replicating the classic childhood game Hangman. 

In the milestone_2.py file, I first created a list of words (fruit themed) and chose a random word from it to start the game. I then developed the logic to check if, the letter entered by the user is valid, and whether the letter is in the random word. 

Next, in the milestone_3.py file, I cleaned up the code by adding the above logic into functions - check_guess and ask_for_input.
